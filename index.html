            <img src="./images/christopher-gower-m_HRfLhgABo-unsplash.jpg" alt="Computer Screen" width="300" height="200" class="right"> <p>My name is Dalton Slattery and I am currently working towards changing my career and becoming a software engineer. My first step in this process began in early 2021 when I started to take courses in Python and SQL through <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. 
                As my knowledge and confidence grew, so did my enthusiasm. I began to find more classes to take and began auditting the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/">CS50</a> course.
                Through CS50 I learned to use C and increase my critical thinking through rigorous challenges and labs. Ultimately, I decided to change my career path from being a Forensic Scientist for the Metro Nashville Crime Lab's Toxicology Unit and go all in to become a software engineer.

                I will begin this new journey by taking the Software Engineer course offered from <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a> in January 2022. By the end of the course, I am hoping to continue to grow in my skills and confidence to become a sought after employee. 
                After speaking with Flatiorn School graduates and reviewing the <a href="https://hi.flatironschool.com/rs/072-UWY-209/images/Flatiron%20School%20Jobs%20Report.pdf?_ga=2.18593979.361397078.1639409002-1623145324.1631887588&_gac=1.152531275.1638990916.Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzOZ19lVtoxq7Erpys1LoB2PtbE0xnUB9CVdJCCJCvQJ4slgT1lUwGMaAndqEALw_wcB">Job Reports</a>
                I belive that this is the best step towards furthering my career change. I am excited to start this journey and I am confident that I will strive in this environment and begin a long and successful career in software engineering.
